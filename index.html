        Engagement and Motivation in Learning: Emotion recognition can assess
        students' emotional states to help educators understand their engagement
        levels during classes. For instance, students may display signs of
        frustration or boredom when facing a challenging task, and emotion
        recognition can help address these issues in real-time. Kahoot!, an
        educational platform, uses emotion recognition to assess how students
        feel during lessons and adapt content to enhance engagement.
